Interpretation and limitations\n\n- The curated series replicates the staging distribution because `lusage` contained few or no missing values; baseline imputation had minimal effect.\n- Lag correlations are strong, consistent with persistence in household electricity usage.\n- The BQML linear regression may exhibit overfitting without additional regularization and higher-quality exogenous features (e.g., weather indices beyond `mozip`). Out-of-time validation is recommended."
